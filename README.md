# Limits printer

limits_printer provides most of the upper and lower bounds of usual C data types.

## Note

Please note that all these variables are extracted from `<limits.h>`

To locate the currently used `limit.h`:
* With GNU `g++ -H <executable>`
* With MSVC activate the `/showInclude` option

Also not that the variables are printed with default settings.

# Future Evolution

* Add an option to print on 0xff format
* Add the CTests
* Print more details on float variables
